# Single-Cycle-RISCV-CPU

This is a project in which I am rewriting a group assignment I contributed to for the class "Digital Systems Design with VHDL and SystemC" (Entwurf digitaler Systeme mit VHDL und SystemC) using Verilog. The project involves the implementation and testing of a single-cycle-CPU based on RISC-V architecture (RV32I).
