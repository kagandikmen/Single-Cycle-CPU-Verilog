# Single-Cycle-RISCV-CPU

This is a project in which I am rewriting a group assignment I contributed to for the class ["Entwurf digitaler Systeme mit VHDL und SystemC"](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/eda/lehrveranstaltungen/?tx_tumcourses_list%5Bc15024%5D=c950695874) (Digital System Design with VHDL and SystemC) using Verilog. The project involves the implementation and testing of a single-cycle CPU based on RISC-V ISA (RV32I).

## Status

The data flow instructions are completed and tested for synthesisability. The design can run fine at 40 MHz on a PYNQ-Z1 board. Some control flow instructions are not implemented yet.

## Contributing

Pull requests, suggestions, bug fixes etc. are all welcome.
