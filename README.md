# Single-Cycle-RISCV-CPU

This is a project in which I am rewriting a group assignment I contributed to for the class "Digital Systems Design with VHDL and SystemC" (Entwurf digitaler Systeme mit VHDL und SystemC) using Verilog. The project involves the implementation and testing of a single-cycle CPU based on RISC-V ISA (RV32I).

## To-Do

- instr_generator.v should be expanded to cover all types of instructions
- There are some places where the code is only behavioural

## Contributing

Pull requests, suggestions, bug fixes etc. are all welcome.
